            <p> Welcome to the Hidden Cove. We have campsites and some really fun things for you to do while you are staying here.</p>
            <p> We are family owned and oriented. We would love for you and your friends to come enjoy some fun. We are also dog friendly.</p>
            <p> The goal for my business is for many people to come and enjoy. Once they do that i hope they will tell their friends to get them to come. I hope my campsite will become very popular that familys will come every year.</p>
